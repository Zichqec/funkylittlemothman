/*

I really would like for him to sometimes spend a long time on a task, but other times alternate tasks quickly. Is this better to do totally random? I feel like no...

Needs to pick between project type
And then between specific project for ghosts
Maybe it's all just one big list though? hm... do i want it weighted.
weighted is probably better for future expansion

Ghost work is also divided into drawing, coding, and writing... These are probably modifiers and not whole pools. in fact this could be a modifier that applies to any task

Maybe I should have it so that he picks between ghosts and other tasks, and if he picks ghosts then he picks one of them at random, and if he picks other tasks he picks one of those at random? that feels like the weighting i want


â†“ these don't have dialogue associated with them, probably? they may but it'll be additional dialogue, not separate pools

Need to also pick how long it'll be until he switches projects
Need to pick if he's in a switch-quickly mood or a switch once in a while mood? Or maybe a totally random option also




TASK PICKING CAN BE **RANDOM**, i don't need to seed this or anything. i only need to make it use EPOCH to determine when he switches modes

Maybe when he mode switches, he also has a chance of switching work type and not project

Yeah there we go

Project
Work type
Mood
