A chat themed balloon for @funkylittlemothman, drawn by Venelona and assembled by Zichqec.

The text appears at the bottom first, for a "chat log" sort of feeling. If this effect is not desired, for example in menus where it may look odd, you can use the two additional balloons that have been provided. b4 is the same size as b0, and b6 is the same size as b2, but b4 and b6 will type from the top like a normal balloon.
